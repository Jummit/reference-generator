# Reference Generator Addon

Tool to generate and update node and class references for GDScripts.

## Usage

To generate node references, select the nodes you want to reference and execute the tool option under `Editor > Tools > Generate Node References`. This will copy the references to the clipboard, which you can then paste in your script.

**Example:**

```gdscript
onready var _referenced_node: Sprite = $Path/To/Node
```

To update the references if you moved or renamed a node, you can copy the references in your script and execute the `Update Node References` option. You can then update the references inside your script with the clipboard.

Class references can be generated by opening the class in the script editor and executing the `Generate Class Reference` option. You can then paste the reference inside your script.

**Example:**

```gdscript
const ReferencedClass = preload("res://path/to/script.gd")
```
